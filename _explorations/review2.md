The Take It Or Leave It Bakery is one of the best bakeries in Pittsburgh, PA. 
The food is absolutely delicious. I, as a chocolate lover myself, love the chocolate
 croissant and the triple chocolate cake! They are one of the best-baked goods
  I have ever tasted. The bread is very good as well, especially when it is
   bought in the morning. (They bake it fresh every day.) Even my least favorite 
   baked good–the French croissant– is not bad. 

Not only is the food good, but the atmosphere is so cozy. I love studying or
 reading here. They always have nice music playing quietly in the background. 
 The workers are all super friendly and accommodating. They never fail to bring 
 a smile to my face.

Finally, the best part of the whole Bakery is the Deliah! She is the best baker
 in the area and so cute! She loves to be a pet and is super friendly.
