The dashboards, in general, show you how many people visit your website over 
time. This is important because it could show you when your restaurant is getting 
more traffic. The amount of users on the website could also be used to track the 
effectiveness of new marketing techniques, like an online ad campaign.   
The dashboards also show you which countries those who view your website are 
from. This could be important to global corporations so that they can know where 
their potential customers are from. Additionally, Google tracks which pages they 
visit. They could clue you into what customers are looking for on your website. 
It could show that they are interested in your menu options or whether they are 
looking for ways to contact your company. It also tracks the average engagement 
time. My site had an engagement rate of 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Finally, Google shows you how people get to your website: whether directly or through a referral.  This could help an owner of a business see how people learned of their website, allowing them to make better marketing decisions.

Below, I have included a picture, showing one of google’s dashboard’s for my website.
